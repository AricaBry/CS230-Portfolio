# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client company wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based game application that is compatible with multiple platforms.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this documentation, I analyzed the unique features, vulnerabilities, and advantages of different operating systems. I felt this is an area I succeeded with the most. I was able to use the knowledge gained from this analysis to make informed recommendations regarding which operating platform is best for the project as well as strategies for effectively managing storage and security systems.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found using the Domain Model to be very useful when developing the code for this project. The UML Diagram cleanly laid out the steps for how the program should run and what components are required.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part of these documents, I would choose to update the Design Constraints section because more information was acquired as the project continued. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted The Gaming Room’s needs and implemented them into the software design document. I detailed the requirements needed for the project to be successful as well as the design constraints based on these requirements. It is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing because if the goals of the application do not meet the user’s requirements, then the application is not usable for the user. Production time is wasted because the final application is incomplete.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When working with software that must be cross-compatible, it was helpful to research and gain some background knowledge on the various operating systems. I will continue to research and gain more knowledge about systems or products I am unfamiliar with so that I can make the best informed decisions. I know that I will also continue to base the design constraints on the client’s requirements to make sure the team working on the application is best prepared.
